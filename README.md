I was working my way thru task 1.4 and then some angels came down. I was having a good time until I had no clue what to SIMDeez nuts meant. Then I had to  debug my matrix multiply so many times! The indexing gave me a lot of trouble cause I was transposing and working with how to get everything going. But eventually I got the bugs resolved and was able to transpose and multiply my matrix. All I had to do after was figure out the powering speedup and OMP, which was really cool cause the repeated squares algorithm was sick (Math 54 :DDDD). I really liked the OMP part because it gave me an idea of how the threads were working and how everything came together was just awesome. Achieving speedups was awesome and seeing how the threads w/ loop unrolling worked was sickkkkk. Loved this project.
